# 2019 Advent of Code (AOC)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# VSCode
I use Visual Studio Code and this git repository contains all files required to run my code. 

# From VBA to Python
This was my first advent of code experience. I started by using Microsoft Excel (vba modules) and managed to get all the way through to Day 16. My style of vba is extreme. I write I write interfaces and classes which is not typical of your average vba programmer. At Day 16, I decided that I wanted to start learning Python. I threw myself into the deep end and did days 1-16 in python. I reviewed code written by others to learn the main techniques e.g. lists, typles, dictionaries and deeper topics like lambda functions, generators and comprehensions. As I learnt new material, I went back to previous days to refactor what I'd already done. Hopefully the result is more aligned with how python programmers approach problems rather than porting the way I programmed in VBA and other languages.

## Intcode Computer
AOC 2019 introduced an Intcode Computer. This was very exciting for me as it reminded me of my earlier experiences of assembly language and machine code. I used the computer as an opportunity to explore what python could do. I added custom enums, event handling, exceptions, queues, etc to really explore how to do things I could do in other languages. I have refactored the code of the intcode computer module many times as I've learnt new python things. I also used test-driven development using the python unittest library and test discovery in vscode.
